# Divergent Design Workflow

## When to use
- Architectural decisions (how to structure a feature, which pattern to use)
- Library or tool selection
- Major feature design where multiple approaches exist
- Any decision where premature convergence is a risk

## Process

### 1. Diverge — generate many possibilities

Generate 8-15 candidate approaches. Quantity matters more than quality at this stage. Requirements:
- Include at least 2-3 approaches that feel wrong, naive, or unconventional
- Include at least 1 "do nothing" or "minimal change" option
- Include at least 1 approach that would be ideal if effort/complexity were free
- One sentence each, no evaluation yet
- Number them for reference

### 2. Diagnose — specify the actual problems and constraints

List every concrete problem, requirement, and constraint the solution must address. Be specific:
- ✓ "The reviewer in IST timezone needs to understand intent in <5 minutes from the PR description alone"
- ✗ "Code should be readable"

Include non-obvious constraints: timezone gaps, skill gaps in the team, maintenance burden, deployment complexity, interaction with existing code, performance requirements. Also note which constraints are hard (must satisfy) vs soft (prefer to satisfy).

### 3. Match and prune

Create a rough compatibility matrix:

| # | Approach | Problem 1 | Problem 2 | ... |
|---|---------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | ...     | ✓         | ~         | ... |

Key:
- ✓ addresses well
- ~ partial or uncertain
- ✗ doesn't address
- ⚠ actively makes worse

For approaches that score well overall but have one fixable weakness, briefly sketch how to fix it (1-2 sentences). Discard anything with ⚠ on a hard constraint or mostly ✗ across the board.

### 4. Tradeoff matrix and decision

For the top 3-5 survivors, create a detailed comparison:

| Approach | Effort (hours/days) | Risk | Core problem coverage | Key downside |
|----------|-------------------|------|----------------------|--------------|

If one approach clearly dominates (>70% confidence): document the decision and proceed.

If the tradeoff is genuinely unclear: **stop and consult the user.** Present the matrix, state your tentative recommendation with reasoning, and identify what information would resolve the ambiguity.

### 5. Document

Create or update `docs/decisions/NNN-title.md` with:
- Context: what prompted the decision
- Options considered (brief — the full analysis doesn't need to be preserved)
- Decision and rationale
- Consequences: what this makes easier, what this makes harder
