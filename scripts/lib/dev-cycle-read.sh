# The dev cycle's reader, used by scripts/dev-cycle.sh and kept apart so the
# planned scripts/build-loop.sh can share it: the output scrub, the plain-file
# and path-form rules, the cycle's own file names, the Markdown shapes the
# readers refuse (FENCE_AWK), the brief and branch checks, and the default
# branch.
#
# Sourced, never run: it only defines functions and variables. Each script
# sources it from its own directory (never from the repo it acts on), so a copy
# of scripts/ with its lib/ is self-contained. The caller sets -euo pipefail,
# cds to the repo root and sets ROOT_REAL (that root, symlinks resolved) before
# calling any file check. inrepo, dirok, skipped and check_brief exit 1
# (need_root) unless ROOT_REAL is set, is the current directory and is a
# repository's top level; while ROOT_REAL is unset, rawfile, plaindir and
# blocker read nothing as plain. Call the exiting checks in the caller's shell,
# not inside $(...) or `local x="$(...)"`, where an exit ends only the subshell.
# skipped records each blocked input in SKIPPED and SKIP_AT. The caller runs
# resolve_main once per process (a second call re-reads main); check_brief and
# check_branch skip every argument unless it returned 0 with main found by name.
# Every script that calls scrub_reexec shares its DEV_CYCLE_SCRUBBED marker.

# The one scrub for everything printed, stdout and stderr: drops C0 controls but
# TAB and LF, DEL, C1 controls (U+0080-009F), bidi controls (U+200E/F,
# U+202A-202E, U+2066-2069), the line and paragraph separators U+2028/2029 (some
# readers split lines on them) and tag characters (U+E0000-E007F), and cuts lines
# longer than 4096 bytes as the scrub receives them (before controls are removed). Perl is pinned to bytes: PERL_UNICODE, PERL5OPT and PERLIO are
# removed (each can turn on UTF-8 decoding and switch the byte patterns off),
# -C0 is set, and both handles are binmoded. C0 goes first; after each deletion
# the search resumes 3 bytes before it (no sequence is longer than 4 bytes), so a
# control byte inside a sequence or a nested sequence cannot reassemble one;
# each search restarts near the last deletion, and the line cut bounds the
# scrub's work per line (the awk readers upstream still read a long line whole).
# Not covered: lone bytes 0x80-0x9F and overlong encodings (invalid UTF-8, which
# a UTF-8 terminal does not decode), U+061C, and invisible format characters such
# as zero-width ones, U+00AD, U+206A-206F and U+FFF9-FFFB (none can start a line).

# Code fences, read only in their plain form, so that every fence this reads is

# or ~ opens one (a ` fence's info string holds no `), and only a column-0 line
# of the same character, at least as long and followed by nothing but spaces or
# tabs, closes it. Any other fence-like line (indented, after a list marker, or
# a column-0 line that neither opens nor, inside a fence, is plain content) is
# ambiguous, and so is anything this reader does not model: outside a fence,
# a line that starts (after spaces or tabs) with < (an HTML block can hold a
# fence line; only a complete one-line <!-- comment --> is read), one that
# opens an HTML comment it does not close, a line starting like a link
# reference definition (after any > and list markers), a
# carriage return inside a line (CommonMark ends a line there), or a
# byte-order mark on line 1: fence() records the first one's line number in
# `odd` (and why in `oddwhy`), and the caller refuses the whole file. A fence
# still open at the end is recorded in `fline` (its opening line) and refuses
# the file too.
# Accepted limit (decision log 69): inline constructs that span lines (an open
# tag attribute, link title, code span, emphasis, or a processing instruction,
# CDATA section or declaration opened mid-line) are not modelled, so text
# CommonMark would hide inside them is read as text. Whoever can write such a
# shape can write the answer or Status line itself; no real file has one.
