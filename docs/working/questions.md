# Running questions

Questions raised during autonomous work that did not justify stopping.

**To answer:** write `Q-0NN: <your answer>` anywhere — a reply, a file, a commit.
The ID is the whole handle; you never have to restate the question. Answers move
the entry to `questions-archive.md`, so this file only ever holds what is still open.

**Needs** is the route — who or what actually discharges the item, from
`docs/working/triage-2026-09-17-backlog.md` §3.1:

### Q-067 · regenerate-skill-eval-reports
**Needs:** deferred · **Opened:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** OPEN

When should the skill eval reports be regenerated, so that the 50 `@needs-reports` suites constrain the current SKILL.md files instead of being NOT RUN?

- **Why it's yours:** regenerating means one headless model run per fixture, about 180 fixtures across 23 skills. Memory [[run-a8-measurement-after-settling]] says no big compute before the A8 measurement.
- **Read:** `docs/working/audit-test-constraint-2026-09-26.md` batch G, and commit 48680e2 (stamps plus the per-skill gate).

| Option | What it means | Cost to you | If it's wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[1] Fold into A8** | Regenerate as part of the A8 run once the code settles | None now | Skill-prompt regressions go uncaught until then, as they have all along |
| **[2] One skill now** | Regenerate one high-value skill (e.g. security-reviewer) to prove the loop end to end | About 12 model runs | A little quota spent before A8 |
| **[3] All now** | `bash test/skills/generate-reports.bash` for every skill | About 180 runs, which may skew A8's baseline | Quota spent, and A8 comparability muddied |

- **Interim:** [1]. The suites print NOT RUN, and health-check warns with the count, so no one mistakes them for a pass.
- **Deferred 2026-09-26 behind Q-071:** under the current stamp design, regenerated reports go stale at the next contract edit, so the suite design comes first.
- **2026-09-27:** Q-071 was answered [1] (narrow stamp, committed reports), so one regeneration now stays valid until the skill itself changes. This remains deferred behind A8 only ([[run-a8-measurement-after-settling]]).
- **If the answer differs:** nothing to redo; only when regeneration happens changes.

### Q-074 · failure-pattern-writer-trigger
**Needs:** trigger · **Opened:** 2026-09-26 · **Status:** OPEN

After the Q-018 backfill (164 entries), `docs/thoughts/failure-patterns.md` has gained 1 entry across about 128 `fix` commits. The writer is still pr-prep Step 0, a workflow step that is advisory only. If it reaches 2026-10-26 with fewer than 5 new entries, reopen L1 as a judgment: automate the harvest, or drop the "do not skip" line.

- **Interim:** nothing changed. The read side (the RPI failure-pattern grep) works.

### Q-075 · si-loop-trust-before-resume
**Needs:** agent · **Opened:** 2026-09-27 · **Status:** OPEN

Q-068 was answered "resume", but only once the user trusts `scripts/self-improvement.sh` not to break their setup. Build the evidence for that: list every path, config, hook, credential and git ref the loop can write outside its own working docs, then run it once hermetically with every env-overridable destination redirected, and diff the setup before and after.

- **Read:** `archive/docs/2026-09-18-handoff-self-improvement-loop.md` §4–§5 · memory [[prove-old-code-fails-hermetically]]
- **Interim:** the loop stays dormant.
- **If the answer differs:** n/a. The output is a report the user reads before the first real run.

### Q-079 · canon-instance-proposal-filter
**Needs:** agent · **Opened:** 2026-09-27 · **Status:** OPEN

Design, per Q-072, (a) a script that turns a commit or commit range into a canon instance, and (b) the higher-level heuristic that decides which candidates get *proposed*. The canon should stay compact and broad in issue types. Growth should be justified by coverage, not triggered by volume. Draft it as a divergent-design doc. The filter choice then comes back as a `you: judgment` entry.

- **Read:** `docs/working/canon-issue-ledger.md` · `review-canon.md` §1 · the 112 September `docs/reviews/` artifacts as the candidate pool
- **Interim:** the ledger is unchanged.

### Q-084 · q076-live-checks
**Needs:** you: terminal · **Opened:** 2026-09-27 · **Status:** OPEN

Q-076 (`cc-push`, the exit scan) was verified only with bats: stubbed docker and local-path remotes, on git 2.39.5. After merging, re-run `install.sh` (it re-blesses; `cc-push.sh`, `cc-exit-scan.sh` and `cc-gitdir.sh` are new), then run this on the host:

```
git --version          # cc-push refuses below 2.39.4 / 2.40.2 / 2.41.1 / 2.42.2 / 2.43.4 / 2.44.1 / 2.45.1 (or <2.46 otherwise)
# 1. a clean session: launch, make one commit, exit claude -> expect exit 0 and no WARNING
cc-isolated ~/path/to/a/scratch/repo
# 2. while that container is still up, in another host shell -> expect a refusal naming the running container
cc-push --remote <your real remote URL> ~/path/to/a/scratch/repo
# 3. stop the container (or exit cc-isolated), then push for real -> expect the preview, then the push
cc-push ~/path/to/a/scratch/repo
# 4. inside any cc-isolated session on the rebuilt image (Q-086, 9e5477a) -> expect a version line
parallel --version | head -1
apt-cache depends parallel                 # Q-086 review C3: note any hard dependency (e.g. sysstat)
bats --jobs 2 test/agents-gemini-sync.bats 2>&1 | grep -iE 'cite|locale'   # expect no output (C2)
```

**2026-09-28 (answers-9-28-26-2.txt), step 3:** `cc-push` refused on `~/claude-workflows` itself (not a scratch repo): "`.git/commondir` exists (a linked worktree's layout)". Cause: the main checkout's `.git` has a stray 1-byte `commondir` holding `.` (it points to itself, so git behaves as if it weren't there). Next to it are an empty `config.worktree` and an empty `modules/`, all dated 2026-07-09 13:45. No commit that day runs `git worktree`, so some tool probably wrote them. `extensions.worktreeConfig` is unset, so git never reads `config.worktree`. `cc-push.sh:272` refuses any `commondir` without resolving it: a false positive on this repo. The fix is Q-091. Steps 1, 2 and 4 are not reported yet.

- **Interim:** every enforcement-file commit on Q-076 carries `Live-verified: no`.
- **If the answer differs:** a refusal on step 3, a warning on step 1, or a version refused that git's release notes list as fixed means a follow-up fix. Also check git's May 2024 security release notes against the version list in the `cc-push.sh` header, which was written from memory.

### Q-091 · cc-push-self-commondir
**Needs:** you: judgment · **Opened:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** OPEN

`cc-push` refuses your main checkout because `.git/commondir` holds `.` (a self-reference that does nothing; see Q-084). Remove the stray file, or teach cc-push to accept it?

- **Read:** Q-084's 2026-09-28 note · `devcontainer-config/cc-push.sh:272` · `commondir_of` in `devcontainer-config/cc-gitdir.sh:50`

| Option | What it means | Cost to you | If it's wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[1] Remove the stray files on the host** | Outside any session: `rm ~/claude-workflows/.git/commondir ~/claude-workflows/.git/config.worktree && rmdir ~/claude-workflows/.git/modules`. cc-push stays as strict as it is. | One paste, then rerun Q-084 step 3 | Whatever wrote them in July may write them again, and cc-push refuses again. Same message, same one-line fix. |
| **[2] Relax cc-push** | Accept a `commondir` whose contents resolve to `.git` itself (reusing `commondir_of`). Refuse everything else as today. | An enforcement-file unit: review loop, re-bless, a host rerun | A resolution bug here opens the exact read-outside-the-checkout hole the check exists to close. |

- **Interim:** nothing changes. cc-push refuses this checkout until one of these is done. Deleting the files from inside a session would trip the exit scan's commondir record, so it isn't done here.
- **If the answer differs:** [2] after [1] is still possible; [1] needs no code change to undo (`printf . > .git/commondir`).

### Q-092 · drop-hook-deny-reader
**Needs:** agent · **Opened:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** OPEN

Per Q-082's answer (`permissions.deny` beats a hook `allow`), remove the Bash deny reader from `hooks/auto-approve-allowed-commands.sh`: the settings-file deny loading, `--deny`, the de-quoted matching and their tests. Update the hook header's rule table to match. This is architecture-review finding 1 on Q-076.

- **Read:** Q-082 in the archive · decision log 53 (amended 2026-09-28) · the hook header
- **Constraint:** this changes an enforcement file, so the plan's pre-mortem lists the bypass families and marks each covered or not before implementing. One case to check explicitly: the host result covers `allow` only. If the hook can ever emit `ask` (#39344 shows `ask` overriding deny), the reader may still be needed on that path.
- **Interim:** the reader stays. It is redundant for `allow`, not harmful.

### Q-088 · spike-weaker-nested-sandbox
**Needs:** agent · **Opened:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** OPEN

Spike, per Q-081 [2]: can Claude Code's `sandbox.enableWeakerNestedSandbox` run Bash sandboxed inside cc-isolated without allowing user namespaces (Docker's default seccomp gives `unshare -Ur` → EPERM)? Success: a sandboxed Bash call in a cc-isolated container that has `bubblewrap` and `socat` but unchanged seccomp/runArgs, with a read of `~/.claude/.credentials.json` refused. Failure: bwrap still needs user namespaces, or the weaker mode drops the filesystem restriction. Then come back with [1] (build the full sandbox) or [3] (accept deny + container) as a `you: judgment` entry.

- **Read:** Q-081 in the archive · the auto-approve hook header · decision log 53.
- **Constraint:** the image has no bwrap/socat and this sandbox has no egress, so the live half needs a Dockerfile branch (an enforcement file) and one host run. Keep that branch unmerged until the spike's answer is in.
- **Interim:** nothing sandboxes Bash in cc-isolated (Q-081's interim [3]).

### Q-089 · host-tools-trust-category
**Needs:** agent · **Opened:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** OPEN

Implement Q-083 [1]: host-only tools (`cc-push.sh`, `cc-exit-scan.sh`, `cc-gitdir.sh`) get their own trust-manifest section and commit trailer (e.g. `Host-tool-tested:`) instead of `Live-verified:`; `cc-push` verifies its own hash before running; `check_manifest` stops blocking cc-isolated launches when only a host tool changed; decision log row 45 is amended.

- **Read:** `docs/reviews/q076-architecture-review-2026-09-27.md` Finding 3 · decision log 45 · `hooks/live-verify-gate.sh` · `enforcement_files` in `devcontainer-config/cc-isolated.sh`.
- **Constraint:** this changes enforcement files, so per RPI step 3 the plan's pre-mortem lists the bypass families (e.g. a tampered cc-push that skips its own check, a manifest section swap) and marks each covered or not before implementing. The unit counts against the ~400-line cap (decision log 62).
- **Interim:** host tools stay in the enforcement set (Q-083's interim [2]).

### Q-090 · run-tests-jobs
**Needs:** trigger · **Opened:** 2026-09-28 · **Status:** OPEN

When `parallel` is present in the image (Q-084 step 4 prints a version), add `--jobs N` to `scripts/run-tests.sh` (suite-level `bats --jobs`, serial when `parallel` is missing) and measure the full-suite wall time against the 742 s serial baseline. install-host.bats, the slowest suite, bounds the speedup.

- **Interim:** the suite stays serial.
- **From the Q-086 review (C2, C5):** `bats --jobs N` with N>1 aborts without `parallel` even on one file, so the serial fallback must test `command -v parallel`, not the file count. bats runs `parallel` without `--will-cite`, so check its citation notice and Perl locale warnings stay out of test output. `--jobs` also parallelizes tests *within* a file, and install-host.bats may flake, since `install.sh`'s `procs_in_checkout` scans the real /proc; consider `--no-parallelize-within-files`.
