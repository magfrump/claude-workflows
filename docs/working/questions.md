# Running questions

Questions raised during autonomous work that did not justify stopping.

**To answer:** write `Q-0NN: <your answer>` anywhere — a reply, a file, a commit.
The ID is the whole handle; you never have to restate the question. Answers move
the entry to `questions-archive.md`, so this file only ever holds what is still open.

**Needs** is the route — who or what actually discharges the item, from
`docs/working/triage-2026-09-17-backlog.md` §3.1:

| Route | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `you: judgment` | Needs your taste or authority. The only real attention spend. |
| `you: terminal` | Needs your machine, not your mind. Collected into one paste below. |
| `agent` | Mechanical. Should not be here long. |
| `trigger` | Not a question yet — a condition being watched. Costs you nothing. |

What is the current mathlib olean cache hostname? (`lake exe cache get` is minutes vs hours per repo.)

- **Attempt 2026-09-17 — your run was against the right file, and the answer is that the question's shape is wrong.** `rg -o 'https://[^"]*' .../mathlib/Cache/Requests.lean` returned exactly two strings: a bare `https://` and `https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git`. A bare prefix means the cache URL is **assembled at runtime**, not written down as a constant — which is also what your sketched docstring describes (`MATHLIB_CACHE_GET_URL` → `--cache-from` → `MATHLIB_CACHE_FROM` → `defaultContainersForRepo repo`). So there may be no single hostname to list: the host comes from a per-repo container list, and an allowlist entry has to name whatever `defaultContainersForRepo` resolves to for mathlib4.
- **Attempt 2026-09-18: half answered, and the entry stays open.** Your paste (`docs/human-author/answers-9-18-26.txt`) settles which *kind* of host it is. `Cache/Marker.lean:34` builds URLs as `s!"{container.azureURL}/m/{normalizeRepo repo}/{sha}"`, so every container is an **Azure Blob** endpoint, not ghcr.io or another registry, and the registry branch of "What I do with it" is ruled out. It does not show the storage-account hostname. `head -60` cut the output off before the definitions of `defaultContainersForRepo` and `azureURL`, where that literal lives. I could guess `lakecache` from the old code, but the VERIFY comment asks for the name to be *seen*, so I am not closing on a guess. Also worth checking: "widens the lookup chain" suggests several containers. An Azure container is a path under one account, so they probably share one host. If they span accounts, the allowlist needs each account.
- **Read:** `devcontainer-config/egress/lean.txt` (the `lakecache.blob.core.windows.net` entry and its ACCEPTED RISK note)
- **The paste**, narrowed to the one missing literal:

```bash
M=verifier/lean-project/.lake/packages/mathlib     # any mathlib4 checkout works
rg -n 'blob\.core\.windows\.net|azureURL|def defaultContainersForRepo' -A6 "$M"/Cache/*.lean
```

- **What I do with it:** if every hostname it prints is `lakecache.blob.core.windows.net`, the VERIFY comment is discharged and the entry stays as it is. If it prints another account, `egress/lean.txt` swaps to it (or lists each one). The ACCEPTED RISK note holds either way, since every candidate is Azure Blob.
- **Interim:** `lakecache.blob.core.windows.net` stays listed, carrying its VERIFY comment. A wrong entry degrades to "stays blocked", never to a wider allowlist, so the cost of being wrong is a slow first build rather than an exposure.
- **If the answer differs:** correct `egress/lean.txt`, re-install, re-bless.
